// Hitesh Choudhary challenges traditional time management advice, emphasizing that modern problems require modern solutions (1:51). He argues that it's impossible to manage time directly because "life is predictably unpredictable" (3:09). Instead, he proposes managing the things that take up your time, specifically people and social media.

// Here are his key secrets for modern time management:

/* You cannot manage time, manage people instead (2:43-3:22). He categorizes people into two types: those who need your time (e.g., family, loved ones, boss) and those who want your time (3:28). Prioritize those who need your time, giving them consistent, small allocations of time to prevent them from demanding larger chunks later (4:24). Kids are a good example of mastering how to manage people (4:47).
Don't detox from social media, master it (5:24-6:04). Social media is an unavoidable part of modern life. Instead of trying to avoid it, use it to your advantage by following accounts that inspire you, motivate you, and make it a learning experience (6:04-6:28).
Underestimate your time (6:41). Hitesh suggests that you can only realistically fit two main tasks into a day: one "white circle" task (what you want to do) and one "black circle" task (what people want you to do) (7:00-7:19). Focus on accomplishing these two things, and consider your day fruitful if they are done (7:51-8:07).
Reward yourself (8:09). Rewards are crucial for motivation, but they should be planned realistically. He advises against rewards that completely cut off from your work or phone, as this is often unsustainable (8:46-9:06). Integrate your work or phone into your reward system to make it feasible and enjoyable (9:06-9:19).
Bonus Tip: Smile and restart (10:16). Life is unpredictable, and things will go wrong (10:25). It's okay to lose control or mess up a day; don't plan too far ahead (10:40). Instead, embrace the concept of "restart" – if today is messed up, you can fix it tomorrow (11:05-11:16).
Focus on one thing at a time, consistently (11:54-12:17). Time management isn't about doing a thousand things, but about doing a few things consistently. The goal is to master today's day (12:30-12:44).
